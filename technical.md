# Technical Profile – Abhishek Banerjee

## Headline
Cloud Architecture & Data Engineer focused on building resilient data platforms, streaming systems, and analytics experiences.

## Summary
I design cloud-native data pipelines that move from raw ingestion to curated, business-ready datasets. My work blends platform reliability, cost optimization, and developer enablement so teams can ship fast and trust their data.

## Core Focus Areas
- Cloud architecture (AWS & GCP), platform engineering, and scalable data platforms.
- Real-time and batch data pipelines, data quality, and observability.
- Analytics enablement: semantic layers, BI performance, and self-service data products.

## Skills Snapshot
- Cloud: AWS, GCP, Terraform, Kubernetes, Cloud Run
- Data: BigQuery, Snowflake, Databricks, Kafka, Pub/Sub, Airflow, dbt
- Engineering: Python, SQL, Spark, CI/CD, GitHub Actions, Infrastructure-as-Code
- Governance: Data lineage, cataloging, security, privacy, cost optimization

## Selected Impact
- Modernized ingestion and warehouse architecture, cutting pipeline latency by 45%.
- Delivered streaming analytics stack that supported 10x event volume growth.
- Built reusable data foundations enabling 20+ stakeholders to self-serve insights.

## Signature Projects
- Data Mesh Platform: multi-tenant ingestion + data product templates.
- Real-Time Event Hub: streaming ingestion, alerting, and anomaly detection.
- Cost Optimization Toolkit: automated BigQuery and Snowflake tuning.

## Pipeline Storytelling
The site experience should mirror a data pipeline:
1. **Ingestion** – ingredients (skills) drop into a boiler.
2. **Processing** – scroll ignites the flame under the boiler.
3. **Transformation** – a spatula mixes the ingredients.
4. **Loading** – the dish is plated into a BigQuery-inspired destination.
